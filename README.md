This is **EPF's Excel Automation created by Darwish Hakim (Intern 21/08/2024).**
It's created to automate the process of compiling the data from a nessus scan and the asset list.
This process was such a hassle back then where you would have to cross-check every single scan and asset list (theres 20k+ scans and thousands of assets)

It's a python program utilizing pandas and openpyxl.

HOW TO USE
- submit tennable nessus scan (MUST BE IN EXCEL FORM)
- submit asset list (MUST BE IN EXCEL FORM)
- click process
